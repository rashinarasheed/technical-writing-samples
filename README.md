# Technical Writing Samples

Thank you for dedicating time to review my technical writing samples. Among them, you'll find an Overview Document detailing a plugin for the React UI framework, MaterialUI, named NextGenMUI, as well as an API Document for the OpenWeather API utilizing OpenAPI 3.0.
I am confident that these samples showcase my ability to communicate technical information effectively while maintaining a high standard of clarity and readability.
If you have any questions or need any clarifications please reach out to me at rashinahere@gmail.com
